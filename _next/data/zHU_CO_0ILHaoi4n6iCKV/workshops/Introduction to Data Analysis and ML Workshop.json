The market is anticipated to grow up to 209.91 billion by 2029.\n\n        Have you ever wondered about the reason behind this growing demand?\n        \n        About Webinar:\n        \n        It is because many leading companies in the world today, such as Facebook, google and uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. The machine learning market size has been steadily growing. It is a type of data mining that allows computers to ‘learn on their own experience.\n        Nowadays, it's not an exaggeration to say that each of us encounters machine learning multiple times daily. And even though saying that machine learning entirely changes the way we live may sound like a cliché, we're going to say and prove that once again with the most impressive and recent statistics. Until the 1960s AI and ML were more or less synonymous, but thereafter they diverged and now they are rampant in the tech industry, mass media and academia.\n        The reason the tech industry is obsessed with technology is that it enables it to build machines that learn from the behaviour of internet users to predict their actions and, in particular, what they are intended to like, value and might want to buy.\n        Probably, you would have noticed that the product you have searched for on the eCommerce website, would abruptly be recommended on social media platforms.\n        The reason behind this incognito is Machine Learning.\n        The major prerequisite of this ongoing technology is data. Data is the lifeblood of all businesses. Companies ideally need to use all of their generated data to derive value from it and make impactful business decisions. Before making this decision comes the Data Analytics.\n        The ability to derive key performance indicators or statistics from data is tedious. With data being scattered around, getting concrete information promptly is problematic. Data Analytics provides a major actionable insight into customer behavior and market behavior. It is a discipline focused on extracting insights from data, including the analysis, collection, organization and storage of data.\n        Currently, the world is being driven digitally with technology and data being present everywhere. It is apparent when Geoffrey Moore said “Without data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway”. The prime aim of data analytics is to apply statistical analysis and technologies to data to find trends and solve problems. The Indian Brand Equity Foundation expects the Data Analytics industry to hit up to $119 billion by 2026. Data Analytics has become important in various businesses across sectors.\n        In the modern era, data is as significant as water. As long as data is present, the widening of these technologies is unstoppable so does the job opportunities. Bill gates once quoted that “A breakthrough in machine learning is worth ten Microsofts”. The average salary rise in these technologies in the past few years is remarkable.\n        This is THE FUTURE is an understatement.\n        \n        Participant's Requirements (Note):\n        \n        Only Windows 10 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) platforms.\n        Memory (RAM): At least 2 GB available, 4 GB or more is recommended.\n        Display: At least 1440x900 or 1600x900 (16:9) required. Lower resolutions such as 1024x768 or 1280x800 aren't supported, as certain controls (such as closing the startup screen) display beyond those resolutions.\n        CPU: 1 GigaHertz (GHz) 64-bit (x64) processor or better recommended.\n        WebView2 needed, if not automatically installed with Power BI Desktop or uninstalled.\n        Power BI Desktop is not supported in Virtualized Environment (eg. Citrix).\n        Latest Version of Microsoft Power BI (Open Sourced Free Application)."}},"__N_SSG":true}
