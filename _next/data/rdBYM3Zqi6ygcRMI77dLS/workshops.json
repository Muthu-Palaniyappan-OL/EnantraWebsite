","multiLineDescription":"Capital management is shortly defined as “a financial strategy aimed at ensuring maximum efficiency in a company's cash flow. “Capital management is a mystery to the vast majority of people. While most understand that money flows through global economies, few grasp the intricacies of putting that capital to work for a company. Thus, many struggles to grasp just what capital management is. An entrepreneur is a term which is used to denote the person who runs or owns two or more businesses. For beginners pursuing business, capital management is much more important because they need to know about the flow of money in the market so they would handle the critical situation whenever the company gets low.\n        \n        Those people should know which is an “asset” and which is a “liability”. Adding a note on the asset, this is the value which will generate income. Assets include buying land, renting a house, starting a business etc. Liability is a term in which the value of the things gets depreciated after buying them. Liability includes buying a car, bike, home etc. the asset is like a long-term investment but the liability is where the money gets exchanged for things, but the thing's value gets low after using it or owning it. Only mathematics is not used to manage money beyond that there are a lot of things hidden in it. \n       \n       Efficient capital management helps ensure your business runs smoothly and includes managing your inventory, accounts receivables, and accounts payables. It also takes maintaining both your short-term assets and liabilities to ensure you have the liquid funds necessary to run your day-to-day operations. \n       \n       The importance of finance in business cannot be sufficiently stressed. Business finance can help entrepreneurs purchase land, capital assets and other assets without much difficulty and can focus solely on commencing the operations of the business. To make sure the next generation of entrepreneurs understands the importance of capital management, AUSEC presents a 2-hour workshop on capital management conducted by Mr Balaji Premkumar, co-founder of the company exemplary.ai. He is the managing director of the law firm, Tanvi Balaji and associates and is the co-founder and former COO of Business Sources inc. The workshop will focus on understanding and identifying areas where one should spend and save money and make wise choices that will provide your startup with a solid financial backbone.\n       Name: Dhanya Venkateswaran\n       "},{"name":"Introduction to Data Analysis and ML Workshop","underDomain":"workshops","icon":"/Workshops/machine-learning-white.png","image":"/Workshops/ml-da.jpg","contactPhone":"+919940315612","location":"CEG, Anna University, Chennai","registrationUrl":"https://unstop.com/workshop/introduction-to-data-analysis-and-ml-workshop-enantra-entrepreneurship-mantra-anna-university-au-chennai-494483","contactEmail":"","date":"30 Nov 22, 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM IST","oneLineDescription":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.","multiLineDescription":"The machine learning market is worth $15.44 billion in 2022. The market is anticipated to grow up to 209.91 billion by 2029.\n\n        Have you ever wondered about the reason behind this growing demand?\n        \n        About Webinar:\n        \n        It is because many leading companies in the world today, such as Facebook, google and uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. The machine learning market size has been steadily growing. It is a type of data mining that allows computers to ‘learn on their own experience.\n        Nowadays, it's not an exaggeration to say that each of us encounters machine learning multiple times daily. And even though saying that machine learning entirely changes the way we live may sound like a cliché, we're going to say and prove that once again with the most impressive and recent statistics. Until the 1960s AI and ML were more or less synonymous, but thereafter they diverged and now they are rampant in the tech industry, mass media and academia.\n        The reason the tech industry is obsessed with technology is that it enables it to build machines that learn from the behaviour of internet users to predict their actions and, in particular, what they are intended to like, value and might want to buy.\n        Probably, you would have noticed that the product you have searched for on the eCommerce website, would abruptly be recommended on social media platforms.\n        The reason behind this incognito is Machine Learning.\n        The major prerequisite of this ongoing technology is data. Data is the lifeblood of all businesses. Companies ideally need to use all of their generated data to derive value from it and make impactful business decisions. Before making this decision comes the Data Analytics.\n        The ability to derive key performance indicators or statistics from data is tedious. With data being scattered around, getting concrete information promptly is problematic. Data Analytics provides a major actionable insight into customer behavior and market behavior. It is a discipline focused on extracting insights from data, including the analysis, collection, organization and storage of data.\n        Currently, the world is being driven digitally with technology and data being present everywhere. It is apparent when Geoffrey Moore said “Without data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway”. The prime aim of data analytics is to apply statistical analysis and technologies to data to find trends and solve problems. The Indian Brand Equity Foundation expects the Data Analytics industry to hit up to $119 billion by 2026. Data Analytics has become important in various businesses across sectors.\n        In the modern era, data is as significant as water. As long as data is present, the widening of these technologies is unstoppable so does the job opportunities. Bill gates once quoted that “A breakthrough in machine learning is worth ten Microsofts”. The average salary rise in these technologies in the past few years is remarkable.\n        This is THE FUTURE is an understatement.\n        \n        Participant's Requirements (Note):\n        \n        Only Windows 10 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) platforms.\n        Memory (RAM): At least 2 GB available, 4 GB or more is recommended.\n        Display: At least 1440x900 or 1600x900 (16:9) required. Lower resolutions such as 1024x768 or 1280x800 aren't supported, as certain controls (such as closing the startup screen) display beyond those resolutions.\n        CPU: 1 GigaHertz (GHz) 64-bit (x64) processor or better recommended.\n        WebView2 needed, if not automatically installed with Power BI Desktop or uninstalled.\n        Power BI Desktop is not supported in Virtualized Environment (eg. Citrix).\n        Latest Version of Microsoft Power BI (Open Sourced Free Application)."},{"name":"Digital Marketing Workshop","underDomain":"workshops","icon":"/Workshops/digital-marketing-white.png","image":"/Workshops/digital-marketing.jpg","contactPhone":"+918870013219","location":"CEG, Anna University, Chennai","registrationUrl":"https://unstop.com/workshop/digital-marketing-workshop-enantra-entrepreneurship-mantra-anna-university-au-chennai-497253","contactEmail":"","date":"01 Dec 22, 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM IST & 01:00 PM to 03:00 PM","oneLineDescription":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.","multiLineDescription":"It's a 4 hour hands-on session on Digital Marketing conducted by Sangeetha S Abishik, A Digital marketing Consultant, Professor, Speaker at various Business forms and Youtuber of Digitally Marketing educational Content.\n\n        The session gives the participants an opportunity to gain immense knowledge on Digitally Marketing their ideas, ways to promote themselves and their ideas through Social media forms such as Instagram, Youtube and Facebook.\n        \n        The importance of marketing for your business or other things is important as it makes the customers aware of your products or services, engages them, and helps them make the buying decision.
